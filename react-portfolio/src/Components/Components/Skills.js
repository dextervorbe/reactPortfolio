I recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp in Pennsylvania, where I developed skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, and responsive web design. I am a fast learner with a passion to create clean code and user-friendly applications. I am comfortable with working in teams within an agile environment. I am always eager and hungry for more knowledge; I believe that the more knowledge you have, the more opportunities are open for you.</p>
